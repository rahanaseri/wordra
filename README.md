We developed a wordpress plugin  with the feature to upload and display the videos from the cassandra database.
This plugin consists of a setup page called BI setting page in the wordpress setting in admin dashboard where the admin passes the IP address of the cassandra database.
Using the shortcode “[upload]” admins can add the upload interface to their page. When uploading the file, the data is streamed directly from the page to the cassandra 
database with the IPaddress that is already set in the BI setting page..streaming the data directly to the database makes it
possible to upload big files without filling up the drive. 
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
